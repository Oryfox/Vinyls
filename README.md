# Vinyls
Java software to manage vinyl records.

Attributes of albums like the title and artist are collected with the cover art.
There are various features available like automatically receiving a cover image via LastFM Api or looking up lyrics on Genius by simply clicking a song.
Vinyls also allows to start watching a music video on YouTube using the YouTube Data API or listening directly to the song downloaded and cached from YouTube
inside the software. In the album overview you are also able to download the whole album from YouTube converted to mp3 and tagged to your Downloads folder.
